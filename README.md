# KIVA
This is a data set that shows the distrubtion of loan from Kiva to people showing the loan amount borrowed, activity the loan is for, country and gender of the person recieveing the loan.
I have been able to get some insight on how the loans are given based on each category using seaborn and matplotlib to visualize my insights.
